# Retail Business Analysis
## Short overview of the project
In this dashboard, I will showcase the business' products and sales kpi analysis, based on the collected data of a real small-retail online business. You can find the [original datasets](uploaded/orig.datasets), as well as [sql queries](uploaded/sql.queries) and [tables](uploaded/finalised.tables) used for the final reporting by clicking on the text.

<b>*Please note</b> that sales and products tables do not relate. The data is very limited, so I tried my best to extract the most valuable insights of it.
