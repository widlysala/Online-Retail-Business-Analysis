# Retail Business Analysis
## Short overview of the project
This dashboard will be devide into 2 main parts, where I will showcase the business' products and sales KPI analysis respectively, based on the collected data of a real small retail online business. You can find the [original datasets](uploaded/orig.datasets), as well as [SQL queries](uploaded/sql.queries) and [tables](uploaded/finalised.tables) used for the final reporting, by clicking on the text.

<b>*Please note</b> that the sales and products tables do not relate. The data is very limited, so I tried my best to extract the most valuable insights.

## Products' KPI

The following chart shows us how company's Net Sales related to the Demand, giving us a perspective on what product types perform better than the others. The demand is calculated by sold goods and not total orders!, where if quantity bigger than the average across all product types it's given to be "High", where if it's lower and also smaller than 100 - "Low", everything else falls in-between - "Average".

From this graph you can clearly see that  "Gift Basket" and "Easter" are the weakest in perforamnce, both by demand and total profits.
