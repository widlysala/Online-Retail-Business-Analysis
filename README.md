# Retail Business Analysis
## Short overview of the project
This dashboard will be devide into 2 main parts, where I will showcase the business' products and sales KPI analysis respectively, based on the collected data of a real small retail online business. You can find the [original datasets](uploaded/orig.datasets), as well as [SQL queries](uploaded/sql.queries) and [tables](uploaded/finalised.tables) used for the final reporting, by clicking on the text.

<b>*Please note</b> that the sales and products tables do not relate. The data is very limited, so I tried my best to extract the most valuable insights.

## Products' KPI

The following chart shows us how company's Net Sales related to the Demand (from lowest to highest). Giving us a perspective on what product types perform better than the others.
